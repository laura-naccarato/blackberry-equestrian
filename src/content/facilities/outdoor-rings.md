Our two professionally maintained outdoor rings provide variety in training environments and ample space for multiple riders. Both rings feature carefully maintained footing and are groomed daily to ensure optimal riding conditions.

### Main Competition Ring
Our expansive main ring is designed to meet competition standards, providing ample space for course work and multiple riders. The ring is regularly used for schooling shows and can accommodate full hunter and jumper courses.

### Warm-up Ring
The dedicated warm-up ring offers a quieter space for flat work, ground pole exercises, and lunging. This ring is perfect for warming up before lessons or cooling down after intensive training sessions.

### Maintenance
Both rings are groomed daily and watered as needed to maintain optimal footing conditions. We use high-quality sand that provides excellent drainage while maintaining consistent cushioning.
