  "body": "# Winter Horse Care in Ontario\n\nWinter in Ontario can be challenging for horse owners, with temperatures dropping well below freezing and snow covering the ground for months. At Blackberry Equestrian, we've developed proven strategies to keep horses healthy and comfortable throughout the winter season.\n\n## Water Management\n\nThe most critical aspect of winter horse care is ensuring adequate water intake. Horses need 10-12 gallons of water daily, even in cold weather.\n\n### Tips for Winter Hydration:\n- Check water buckets and automatic waterers twice daily for ice\n- Provide lukewarm water when possible - horses prefer it to ice-cold water\n- Add salt to feed to encourage drinking\n- Consider heated buckets or tank heaters for outdoor water sources\n\n## Feeding Adjustments\n\nHorses need more calories in winter to maintain body temperature. The process of digesting hay actually helps horses stay warm through fermentation heat.\n\n### Winter Feeding Guidelines:\n- Increase hay rations by 10-20% in cold weather\n- Provide hay throughout the day, especially during cold snaps\n- Monitor body condition score weekly\n- Consider adding a fat supplement for hard keepers\n\n## Blanketing Decisions\n\nNot all horses need blankets, but understanding when and how to blanket is important.\n\n### Blanketing Guidelines:\n- **Clipped horses**: Blanket when temperatures drop below 10Â°C\n- **Unclipped horses**: Usually fine without blankets unless elderly or thin\n- **Wet conditions**: Always remove wet blankets immediately\n- **Check fit**: Ensure blankets aren't rubbing or restricting movement\n\n## Hoof Care\n\nWinter hoof care requires special attention to prevent problems.\n\n### Winter Hoof Tips:\n- Pick hooves daily to prevent ice ball formation\n- Consider snow pads for shod horses\n- Apply hoof conditioner to prevent cracking\n- Maintain regular farrier schedule\n\n## Exercise and Turnout\n\nMaintaining regular exercise is important for physical and mental health.\n\n### Safe Winter Exercise:\n- Check footing carefully before riding\n- Warm up slowly in cold weather\n- Consider hand-walking on icy days\n- Ensure proper cool-down to prevent chilling\n\n## Barn Management\n\nProper barn management keeps horses comfortable while maintaining good air quality.\n\n### Winter Barn Tips:\n- Maintain ventilation even in cold weather\n- Remove wet bedding promptly\n- Check for drafts at horse level\n- Keep aisles clear of ice and snow\n\n## Health Monitoring\n\nWinter brings unique health challenges that require vigilance.\n\n### What to Watch For:\n- Signs of colic (can increase with decreased water intake)\n- Respiratory issues from poor ventilation\n- Weight loss\n- Skin conditions under blankets\n- Thrush from wet conditions\n\n## Emergency Preparedness\n\nOntario winters can bring severe weather. Be prepared:\n\n- Keep 3-5 days of extra feed and bedding\n- Have backup water sources\n- Maintain emergency contact list\n- Keep first aid supplies stocked\n- Have a backup power source for critical systems\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWinter horse care doesn't have to be overwhelming. With proper preparation and daily attention to your horse's needs, winter can be an enjoyable season for both horses and riders. At Blackberry Equestrian, our experienced staff ensures all boarders receive excellent care throughout the winter months.\n\nIf you have questions about winter horse care or would like to tour our heated facilities, contact us today!",
