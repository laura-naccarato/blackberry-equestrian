## Date: October 7, 2025

### Content Types Removed:
1. **Team Members Collection** - Removed from CMS and site
2. **Testimonials Collection** - Removed from CMS and site

### Files Changed:

#### CMS Configuration
- `/public/admin/config.yml` - Removed team and testimonials collections

#### Store & Utilities
- `/src/stores/content.js` - Removed team and testimonials state, computed properties, and methods
- `/src/utils/contentLoader.js` - Removed `loadTeamMembers()` and `loadTestimonials()` functions
- `/src/composables/useContentValidation.js` - Removed team and testimonial validation functions

#### Content Files
- Deleted `/src/content/team/` directory and all files
- Deleted `/src/content/testimonials/` directory and all files

#### Views
- `/src/views/AboutPage.vue` - Updated team section to be a generic professional team section without individual profiles

#### Documentation
- `/AGENTS.md` - Updated content collections list
- `/.prompt/doc/CMS-GUIDE.md` - Removed team and testimonials sections
- `/.prompt/doc/CMS_ACCESS.md` - Updated collections list and file structure

### Rationale:
The team members and testimonials content types were removed to simplify the content management system and reduce maintenance overhead. The About page still maintains information about the professional team but in a more streamlined, static format that doesn't require individual profile management.

### Alternative Implementation:
If team or testimonial content is needed in the future, it can be:
1. Added as static content in the About or Home pages
2. Managed through the Pages collection as structured content
3. Re-implemented as collections if the business requirements change

### Build Status: âœ… Successful
The project builds and runs correctly after these changes.
